Peasant Survival

This game will be about a peasant getting attacked by knights of a noble as the peasants refuse to pay the tax anymore to the noble, so you would start with a basic peasant that does little to no damage to the enemy peasant(which is the player character) will fight off swarms of growing soldiers or varying quantity. the peasants will gain experience which will allow them to gain new weapons and perks to fight off these swarms.

This will be roguelike, like many others you have seen, it will have a medieval setting. so expect varying weapons like bows, crossbows, swords, maces, and others.
